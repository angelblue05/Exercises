If we declare a variable and make it equal to Math.random(), that variable will equal a number between 0 and 1.

Let's meet an interesting symbol called modulo. When % is placed between two numbers, the computer will divide the first number by the second, and then return the remainder of that division.

Let's talk about an important concept: scope. Scope can be global or local.

Variables defined outside a function are accessible anywhere once they have been declared. They are called global variables and their scope is global.

Every for loop makes use of a counting variable. Here, our variable is called i (but it can have any name). The variable has many roles. The first part of the for loop tells the computer to start with a value of 1 for i. It does this by declaring the variable called i and giving it a value of 1.

When the for loop executes the code in the code block—the bit between { }—it does so by starting off where i = 1.
