Indentation: To denote a parent element from a child element, you need to add 4 whitespaces infront of the child element.
Comments: # for a single line, """ multi-lines """

list: [item_1, item_2]
slicing: We start at the index before the colon and continue up to but not including the index after the colon.
slicing[1:3]

addition = 72 + 23
subtraction = 108 - 204
multiplication = 108 * 0.5
division = 108 / 9
exponents = 2 ** 3 would equal 8, 2 to the power to 3 (2^3)
modulo: returns the remainder from a division example: 5 % 2 would return 1
comparators:
  Equal to (==)
  Not equal to (!=)
  Less than (<)
  Less than or equal to (<=)
  Greater than (>)
  Greater than or equal to (>=)


module: to simply import a module. Requires to call the module before the function like module.function()
import module

function module: import only a specific function from a module
from module import function

universal imports: to import without having to type out the name of the module infront of the function 
from module import * 
  
  
     Boolean Operators
------------------------      
True and True is True
True and False is False
False and True is False
False and False is False

True or True is True
True or False is True
False or True is True
False or False is False

Not True is False
Not False is True

The order, when not using () to define a unit
-------------------------
not is evaluated first;
and is evaluated next;
or is evaluated last.

%s for strings
%f for floats (numbers with decimals)

There is no difference between using single quotes ' and double quotes "
In Python, we start counting the index from zero instead of one.

Escaping a character: You can use the backslash \ to prevent code break. 'There\'s a backslash'
To import libraries, add at the top of the file: from datetime import datetime

print 5 >> 4  # Right Shift
print 5 << 1  # Left Shift
print 8 & 5   # Bitwise AND
print 9 | 4   # Bitwise OR
print 12 ^ 42 # Bitwise XOR
print ~88     # Bitwise NOT
