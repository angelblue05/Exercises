Inside the empty $(), you'll want to enter the name of the HTML element you want to fade away when clicked. For instance, if it were a paragraph, we'd type

$('p').fadeOut(1000);
In this case, though, we want to make our div disappear.

You can think of the element name passed to jQuery as identical to the CSS element, only wrapped in quotes.

Just like we need a <link> tag to connect our HTML and CSS, we need a <script> tag to connect our HTML and jQuery. The tag looks like this:

<script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
Note that the <script> tag is not self-closing; it requires a closing </script> tag.

We can apply a fadeTo() to both the p and li selectors like this:

$('p, li').fadeTo('slow', 0);
This is called a compound selector.

If you use single quotes for your string, you'll need to escape the apostrophe in "I'm a paragraph!" by putting a \ before it (like so: 'I\'m a paragraph!'). This lets jQuery know not to end the string when it hits the apostrophe.

.html() can be used to set the contents of the first element match it finds.
.val() is used to get the value of form elements.
