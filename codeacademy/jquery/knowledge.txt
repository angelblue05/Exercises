Inside the empty $(), you'll want to enter the name of the HTML element you want to fade away when clicked. For instance, if it were a paragraph, we'd type

$('p').fadeOut(1000);
In this case, though, we want to make our div disappear.

You can think of the element name passed to jQuery as identical to the CSS element, only wrapped in quotes.

Just like we need a <link> tag to connect our HTML and CSS, we need a <script> tag to connect our HTML and jQuery. The tag looks like this:

<script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
Note that the <script> tag is not self-closing; it requires a closing </script> tag.
