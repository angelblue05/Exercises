The number of HTTP methods you'll use is quite smallâ€”there are just four HTTP "verbs" you'll need to know! They are:

GET: retrieves information from the specified source (you just saw this one!)
POST: sends new information to the specified source.
PUT: updates existing information of the specified source.
DELETE: removes existing information from the specified source.

So when we sent our GET request to codecademy.com, we retrieved information. When you add to or update your blog, you're sending POST or PUT requests; when you delete a tweet, there goes a DELETE request.

An HTTP request is made up of three parts:

The request line, which tells the server what kind of request is being sent (GET, POST, etc.) and what resource it's looking for;
The header, which sends the server additional information (such as which client is making the request)
The body, which can be empty (as in a GET request) or contain data (if you're POSTing or PUTing information, that information is contained here).
